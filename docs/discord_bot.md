# Set up a Discord Bot for Stretch

To create a discord bot to chat with your stretch, you'll need to use the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to create a custom application. This document will walk you through the steps to authorize the app in discord and to get the token needed to run the bot. These instructions are based on the [Discord Developer Portal Documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) and on [a previous writeup](https://github.com/cpaxton/virgil/blob/main/docs/discord.md).

First, you will go into the developer portal and click on the "New Application" button. This will allow you to create a new application that will be your bot.

![Name your Application](images/discord_name_app.png)

Enter a name. We suggest naming your new bot after your Stretch, since you will be using it to chat with your robot specifically. In the example above, I named my bot "Stretch3005."

After this, I can see Stretch3005 listed under my applications. Click on it to continue.
