# Robocasa Installation

You can install Robocasa by following the instructions below, or you can try the [install script](scripts/install_robocasa.sh).

## Installation

### Install Robosuite

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative/robosuite -b robocasa_v0.1
cd robosuite
pip install -e .
```

### Install Robocasa

```bash
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/robocasa/robocasa
cd robocasa
pip install -e .
```

### Install Stretch Mujoco

```bash
cd ..
git clone git@github.com:hello-robot/stretch_mujoco.git
cd stretch_mujoco
pip install -e .
```

### Download assets

```bash
python robocasa/scripts/download_kitchen_assets.py   # Caution: Assets to be downloaded are around 5GB.
python robocasa/scripts/setup_macros.py              # Set up system variables.
```

### Upgrade Protobuf

As of 2024-12-04, you may need to update Google protobuf because of an issue with Google text-to-speech:
```bash
pip install --upgrade protobuf
```

You may see a compatibility error in pip, but it should not make a difference.

## Run Robocasa

In one terminal start the server:

```bash
python -m stretch.simulation.mujoco_server --use-robocasa
```

In another run an app, like mapping:

```bash
# Just point the app to the local IP address instead of to your robot.
python -m stretch.app.mapping --robot_ip 127.0.0.1
```

Using the `--robot_ip` option will update your default IP address; you will need to reset it or provide it again to connect to your physical robot from the same machine.
